# First steps

###  The ROCKPro64 charateristics are:
* Rockchip RK3399 Hexa-Core (dual ARM Cortex A72 and quad ARM Cortex A53) 64-Bit Processor with MALI T-860 Quad-Core GPU. 
* 4GB LPDDR4 system memory and 128Mb SPI boot Flash. 
* 16GB eMMC module and microSD slot for booting. 
* PCIe x4 open ended slot, 1x USB 3.0 type C Host with DP 1.2, 1x USB 3.0 type A Host, 2x USB 2.0 Host, Gigabit Ethernet.
* PI-2 GPIO Bus, MiPi DSI interface, eDP interface, touch Panel interface,  stereo MiPi CSI interface.
* Other peripheral device interface: UART, SPI, I2C.

## 1. Debian buster installation
Get the [latest version](https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-build/releases) of Debian for the ROCKPro64 for GitHub.
You then need to get the operating system on the eMMC module. The eMMC module is a bit like an SD card, but you canâ€™t plug it into you computer. However, you can plug it in the USB adapter you just bought.
Flash the downloaded image into the eMMC module with [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
Put the eMMC into the board and plug the power connector, and wait 1 minute.

## 2. Connecting to the machine
Once started you can connect via SSH (first you should know the IP address the router has assigned it) using the user/password rockpro64.
The first time you login it will ask you to change the rocpro64 user password.

## 3. Checking for updates
Is one of the things I use to do:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
## 4. Configure a static IP
First, disable and stop NetworkManager.
```
rock64@rockpro64:~$ sudo su
[sudo] password for rock64: 
root@rockpro64:/home/rock64# systemctl stop NetworkManager
root@rockpro64:/home/rock64# systemctl disable NetworkManager
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/NetworkManager.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service.
Removed /etc/systemd/system/network-online.target.wants/NetworkManager-wait-online.service.
```
Edit the file /etc/network/interfaces
```
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.110
    broadcast 192.168.1.255
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    dns-nameservers 192.168.1.5
```
Restart both networking and resolvconf to see the change take effect. 
```
# systemctl restart networking
# systemctl restart resolvconf
```
